==============================================
Author: Esref Selvi
Date: December 2025

1. FINAL MODEL SELECTION
------------------------
* Selected Model: XGBoost Regressor
* Reason: Outperformed Linear Ridge and Random Forest in initial trials.
* Objective: Predict listing prices based on features like location, room type, and availability.

2. HYPERPARAMETERS (Optimized)
------------------------------
The following parameters were used in the final XGBoost estimator:

* n_estimators: 500
* learning_rate: 0.03
* max_depth: 5
* colsample_bytree: 0.7
* random_state: 42
* n_jobs: -1

3. PERFORMANCE METRICS (Test Set)
---------------------------------
Evaluation performed on the unseen test split:

* R-Squared (R2): 0.4213
  (The model explains approx. 42% of the variance in pricing.)

* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 20,168.22
  (Average deviation from the actual price.)

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 13,218.32

* Comparison with Baseline:
  - Random Forest R2: 0.4176
  - Ridge Regression R2: 0.2700

4. FEATURES & PREPROCESSING
---------------------------
* Input Features: Neighbourhood, Room Type, Availability, etc.
* Preprocessing: One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables, standard scaling for numericals within a Pipeline.

5. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------
The gap between Train R2 (0.75) and Test R2 (0.42) suggests overfitting. Future work could include:
- Increasing regularization (L1/L2).
- Reducing tree depth.
- Collecting more data on property amenities.
